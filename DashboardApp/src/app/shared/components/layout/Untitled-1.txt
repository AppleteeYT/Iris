“Poetry is like standing on the edge of a lake on a moonlit night
 and the light of the moon is always pointing straight at you.” -Billy Collins.

This quote of Billy Collins describes exactly what Billy's poem "Introduction to Poetry" describes;
 poetry is something to be approached to with an open mind, one must explore what a poem means,
 how it applies to our lives,
